Scene Editor
============

This is an old tool but might stil be useful if you find yourself having to edit ASCP or APZ data files...

The really bad thing is there is NO UNDO for anything!

File menu
---------
Open: opens up '.comp' files. Won't open .objs.
Save: saves entire tree for any modified files.

Tree View
---------
Shows composite structure.
Right click on an element to delete etc.
Properties lets you specify pos and rotation.
Drag and drop works but there is no undo!

2D View
-------
Selection: you select elements in the tree view.

Shift + LMB drag: pans.
Shift + RMB drag: zooms in and out.

Ctrl + LMB: move selected.
Ctrl + RMB: rotate selected.

Positions and rotations can snap to nearest.
(change in File|Preferences)

3D View
-------
Shift + LMB: drag to rotate.
Ctrl + LMB: up/down to zoom, left/right to pan.
