Constraints:
 - Try a fixed particle 'buddy' for every movable particle. The movable particle is
connected to the fixed particle with a spring

 - Try a fixed particle at the centre of mass. All the movable particles are connected
by a spring to the fixed COM particle


Drawing
Make/update dynamic indexed tri strip from spring system.
Recalc normals when particles move - we want smoothing groups, as a newly created surface 
 (interior created by a cut) will be at right angles to original mesh.
 - Material class


Collisions:
Ray cast into scene to find contact point on mesh.
 - So build collision mesh from spring system, update when particles move
 - Octree


Apply a force
Find closest particle to pick ray. (Don't need to tesselate until we cut?)
