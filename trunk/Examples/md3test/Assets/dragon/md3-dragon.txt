Description

A gallent knight riding upon his sturdy Dragon steed.  This model is the successor to the 
original Dragon Knight for Quake 2.  


Other Info

A cool feature of the quake3 animation system is the ability to define the length of almost any animation.  This, along with a great
compiling tool from work, meant I was able to do nice long idling sequences and death scenes that convey much more personality and
emotion than in previous ppms I've done.  All this extra eye candy comes at a cost though, the extra frames bloat the md3 files quite
considerably, and even on a high end computer just a couple of these guys running around on screen can seriously slow the action down.

Another point to note is that the death scenes are quite long, taking about 20-25 seconds to fully play out.  Since quake3 
automatically skips to the final death frame once you respawn, the only way to see the entire loop is to not respawn until the 
animation is finished.  Bots, of course, respawn instantly regardless so the death anims will always get cut short if your playing
against bots.  I have vague plans to do a 'deathmatch friendly' version with much shorter, practical animations.  

What would I have done differently?  I regret not taking more time with the uv maps, its pretty shoddy in parts and really caused the 
skinners unnecessary grief.  You'd think I'd have learned by now :)  There are some problems with the general design of the dragon,
particulary the front legs.  I should have thickened them up considerably to be convincingly 'load bearing', or shrunk them right down
to t-rex like claws that don't touch the ground at all.  The middle ground they tread as they are doesn't really work.  Other than these
few niggling issues I'm pretty happy with how the whole thing turned out.
