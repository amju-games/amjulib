This is a basic example of how to use the USB Gecko Special Edition. There are two folders which contain source codes for both client and host (Wii). The Host files will compile only if you have devkitpro and libogc installed. The Client files will only compile if you have libusb and libftdi installed.

A tutorial on how to install devkitpro and libogc can be found on the USB Gecko SE website http://www.usbgecko.com/

See the basic developers guide for information on the program functions.

If you have any problems with the running the examples or installing the drivers, please post on the USB Gecko forums.
