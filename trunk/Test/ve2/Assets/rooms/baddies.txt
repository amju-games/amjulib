IDEAS FOR BADDIES
=================
Associate different baddie types with different environments.
E.g. snakes live in Log piles.

ANTS! - leafcutter ants - you have to get through gaps. Patrol behaviour.
 - Make the ants and leaves separate for different combos. The leaves
  don't give you damage.
 ** Some leaves could be beneficial**

Flies buzzing around in a cloud.
Give each fly a different patrol dir and rect.

Other insects - but currently baddies don't face their direction.

Arrows which whizz across screen - this is also a Patrol job.
Give a long rect - much longer than room.

Spiders: start off with one big one, quite slow. 
Many small ones is difficult to deal with, so comes in a more advanced room.
Could be patrol or chase.

Differnt coloured spiders.

Spikes which shoot out of holes - this is Toggle behaviour.

Fire: needs a good fire sprite sheet. Could be a Toggle.

Moving sheets of fire, using Patrol.

Rolling barrels - Patrol.

Fleeing baddies give health boost

Rocks - stationary - chase speed 0.
they are baddies so can be shot, revealing new rooms. Look slightly different.
Baddie statues.

Venus fly trap - toggle

Snake - patrol

Spider on web thread, comes from top of screen - patrol

Birds - fly up -- patrol. 
Big birds walk across screen - patrol

Bats - could swarm - chase.

Lava pools - in sandy/rocky locations

FISH in water

BOSSES
======

Simply multiple baddies, but need to keep relative position. So Patrol only.
TODO Detect when all constituent baddies have been destroyed.

Spider Skull boss:
Skull with spiders coming out of his mouth etc - patrol, so they reappear in mouth.


MORE "HARMLESS" DECORATION
==========================

Trees, flowers, vines/creepers.
Can hide baddies, treasure, or exits to other rooms.
