Background:
The year is 2029. The years of darkness has fallen upon humans. The machines... once ours to control, now roam the lands seeking to terminate all humans and other life forms. Humans are now slaves to the machines.

The Terminator unit model T-800, the most versatile unit in SkyNET's forces has been of interest to the Vadrigar. The machine knows no remorse, kills as programmed. It does not rest nor gets tired. It just keeps on doing what it is programmed to do. Thus, the Vadrigar snatched one unit from SkyNET, enhanced it's abilities more, giving it more flexibility which more closely match the agility of the T-1000 units.

No... the gladiators in the Arena Ethernals has one more serious problem to worry about... the Terminator is here and it is one bad ass!
