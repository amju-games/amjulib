Accessory's description	: Truly a throwback to ancient times, the Knight comes to the Arena from the dark ages
			  of mankind. His first few forays into battle were disastrous - clusmy and slow, 
			  plate armor is no match for a rocket launcher. After much amusement was had at the
			  Knight's expense, he was finally brought into the current era. Outfitted with modern
			  body armor and a new sword, the Knight is ready to do battle in the far future.

			  
Other info              : The Knight is a model I've had laying around on my hard drive for a long time.
			  He is an early attempt at creating a player model - so please forgive the lack of
			  quality apparent in the skins, model, animation, and deformation.

Additional Credits to   : id, Discreet, Adobe, etc. etc.
