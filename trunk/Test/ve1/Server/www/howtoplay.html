<b>How to download and install the game</b>

Once unzipped, double-click on the My Game icon to run the game. The first time you do this, you get a warning as you are running a potentially dodgy program from the internet!

<br>If you don't, that's a serious problem! Please log a bug in the bug database! Click Start, then Multiplayer game. You then log in to the game using your email address, (but no-one else sees it - it's just a way of uniquely identifying you).
<br><br>
There is a small game world consisting of two connected locations. To move, click the ground where you want to go. You can chat to other players by clicking on them, if they are online.
<br><br>
<b>What to do when you find bugs</b>

As you find problems with the software, please enter a bug in the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/amju-mygame/issues/list" target="_blank">bug database</a>.
