New gui elements to make
========================

Scissor region: this is what GuiWindow is supposed to do? So maybe just fix the internal impl.

Tab and shift-tab: elements must be in a doubly-linked list.

All elements should have border which can be drawn ?

Table/grid type

Tree view

Preview dialog should work with more file types (pluggable design)

Gui design tool
===============
Tree view to compose composite tree
Drag/resize box


Text Edit bugs
--------------

Can't select final 2 chars with mouse??
 - need to set brkpt in msvc

OK? - Change caret pos with mouse - seems to be OK, but doesn't feel very accurate.


Horiz text scrolling when caret moves from is wrong moving from right edge to left - caret should move, not the text

OK? Selection - with shift.  - seems to work OK

OK? Movement: by word: Left + ctrl (win) or option [alt](mac) - seems to work OK

Multi-line text edit:
 vector of single-line text edits??? -- i.e. GuiTextEdit is always only single line.


GuiTextEdit: Selection bugs. Clicking past the end of the test should put the caret/selection point at the end.
 - related to not being able to select final 2 wiht mouse?
 
OK? - GuiTextEdit: caret doesn't move – need to rebuild tris?? Better if caret is separate tri list
GuiTextEdit: cut/copy/paste/select – none of this is working [any more :-( - did copy/paste work?]
GuiText: calc first/last doesn't take font size or scaleX into account
