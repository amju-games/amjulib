// Wrapper around Lua API.
// We want to load lua scripts, call functions in the scripts, and register
// C functions for the scripts to call.
//
// Current design idea is that you subclass this; create static functions 
// for the C(++) functions you want to expose to lua scripts, and register
// the static functions in the subclass ctor.
//
// Expected use:
//  - Subclass, registering new functions; or, compose with a Lua object, and
//    register functions explicitly.
//  - Call an 'Update' lua function each game loop if required.
//  - Call new lua functions when game events occur. These lua functions will
//    call C(++) functions which were registered in step 1.
// This should enable an event-driven framework where the actual game 
// mechanics are in lua scripts, but all the graphics, physics, OS interaction,
// etc is handled by the Amju C++ engine.
