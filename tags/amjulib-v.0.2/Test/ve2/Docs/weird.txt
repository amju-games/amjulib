WEIRD


FINISH TRAIL MAKING TEST

OTHER TESTS

TODO Balance how much score improvement we get for giving food, for Stroop tests, etc.
 (grep SCORE_KEY)

Scoring etc:
 - you have a SCORE which only goes up - OK
 - you have health which can go down on contact with baddies. Replenished with food. 
  - if health hits zero, you die - back to room 1. -- OK!
 - bonus items to collect (treasure) 


Baddies 
 - static -- OK
 - animated - have harmless/harmful state
 - moving

- general sprite-based type, or node type?


Unravelling the mess of scores, health, stamina, persistent data, etc.
======================================================================

GSMain::SetScore() -- called by player when SCORE_KEY changes.

Player collides with food:
In single player: +1 score (SCORE_KEY). +1 FOOD_EATEN_KEY

In multi player: food is given from one player to another.
When given food: +1 score for giver and recipient. 
 +1 FOOD_RECEIVED_KEY for recipient. +1 FOOD_GIVEN_KEY for giver.

OK - improvements:
 - immediately update score. Show score changing, e.g. font momentarily jumps
 - show sparkly effect




*You can throw rocks at baddies* 
But big baddies need lots of hits, so collab.
BUT this means shared view of baddie.
This can work on a private per-client.


Game start pos can be in a wall
Food gets put in wrong place
 - both due to Room not being centred at origin. 
 - OK - but rooms too small. Still not sure about tile size


Game Objects are bunched up at (0, 0)
 - Only food now: not downloading other game objs. Set them in room file.
  - OK, but coll det not working - fixed, pos


Fix offsets for room-room navigation
 - i.e. you shouldn't have to go so far off screen to exit to next room


Implement obstacles - DONE

????
Coll det: use 2D, NOT AABBs. Don't cull in scene graph.



?????
Camera: don't always follow player, depends on distance to room edge.
This is to avoid seeing the black space outside the room.
(Ortho proj)


Notifications
 - why are they not working - OK, working now.
 - I thought they were supposed to be turned off but they are not in login.pl or sendnotification.pl
 ...UNSOLVED: Where did they get turned off?!!


Locations
 - where is loc 57 coming from??
 - why not in Windows build??
 - OK, was because using localhost on Mac.

 STROOP - 4 buttons
