This PPM was made by Crash and Frankie in lightwave + Skinners.
Crash and Frankie both made the model and skinmapped it.
Frankie Animated it and converted it using Mike Bristols lwo to md3 converter.

The skinners who worked on this project were :

Strange Fate - Red + Blue
Soul - Eldritch
Marine - Default + Beresark
Rooster - Blood thorn
Mojo (skin lost in hd crash) - Pig Knight
Fearme  - Dembones.
Fardreamer - Bonemarrow

Almost all the skins are in 512x512 res. There may be an update later with skins in 256x256 res.

Note.

I would like to say sorry for the poor animations/mesh/skinmesh. There are a load of errors in this model, some are more noticable than others but beleive me I know about all of them.
