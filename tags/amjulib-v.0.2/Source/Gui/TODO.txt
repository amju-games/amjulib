New gui elements to make
========================

Tab and shift-tab: elements must be in a doubly-linked list.

All elements should have border which can be drawn ?

Table/grid type

Tree view

Preview dialog should work with more file types (pluggable design)

Gui design tool
===============
Tree view to compose composite tree
Drag/resize box


Text Edit bugs
--------------

Change caret pos with mouse

Horiz text scrolling when caret moves from is wrong moving from right edge to left - caret should move, not the text

Selection - with shift. 

Movement: by word: Left + ctrl (win) or option [alt](mac)  

Multi-line text edit

GuiTextEdit: Selection bugs. Clicking past the end of the test should put the caret/selection point at the end.
GuiTextEdit: caret doesn't move – need to rebuild tris?? Better if caret is separate tri list
GuiTextEdit: cut/copy/paste/select – none of this is working [any more :-( - did copy/paste work?]
GuiText: calc first/last doesn't take font size or scaleX into account
