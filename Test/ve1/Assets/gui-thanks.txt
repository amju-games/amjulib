Thanks for participating in this research project! I hope you find it enjoyable.\n\nYou are asked to play this game a total of 8 times, over the course of 4 weeks. I will show you a calendar of when to play.\n\nIn the game, you are asked to take some tests. This is part of the research project, and I am sorry if it's a bit boring.\n\nWould you like to see the calendar now?
