Model description       : Personal tank with too much AI from Masamune Shiro "Ghost in the Shell" manga

Other info              : Appoligies for the textures, still using mouse, code and photoshop filters. Also learnt that the texture alpha is written to the screen when a texture is rendered (so sucessive stages of a shader can use the screen alpha, that is pretty smart of ID)
Was not bothered to spend a few hours to write out chat for the bot, so wrote some code instead, hehehhe, FRAG COW is 0x4652414720434f57, just ascii to hex...
