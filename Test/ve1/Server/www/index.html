<b>About "My Game"</b>
<br>
"My Game" is an experimental multi-player online game. It is being developed to test the hypothesis that <i>a multi-player online video game can provide a form of cognitive rehabilitation for people with an acquired brain injury</i>.
<br><br>I am following the <a href="methodology.pdf" target="_blank">"staged release" methodology</a> (McConnell, 1998). In this methodology, the initial concept, requirements and architectural design are fully developed, before an incremental, iterative sequence of releases begins. I have finally got to the stage of testing the first public release of the software, and I am recruiting a small focus group for this initial stage. 
<br><br>

<b>How to join in</b>
<br>
Please email me to be added to the list of participants. I would like you to download the client software, install and run it, and then complete a short questionnaire about your experiences. 
As you find problems with the software, please report the bugs in the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/amju-mygame/issues/list" target="_blank">bug database</a>. You need a google account to sign in to the bug database. If you don't have a google account, you can just email me with details of the problem.

<br><br>
<b>System requirements</b>
<br>
<img src="mac-icon.png">
Mac: Tested on Intel and PowerPC-based Macs with Mac OS X 10.6. Does not run on earlier versions of Mac OS X - I will support earlier versions of Mac OS X in future releases.
<br>
<img src="win-icon.png">
Windows: Tested on Windows XP, Vista and 7, on 32-bit and 64-bit machines.</font>

<b>How to download and install the game</b>
<br>
<img src="mac-icon.png">
Mac: click on the download link above. This downloads a zip file. Depending on your browser, this may be automatically unzipped, or you may have to do it manually. Once unzipped, double-click on the My Game icon to run the game. The first time you do this, you get a warning as you are running a potentially dodgy program from the internet! 
<br>
<img src="win-icon.png">
Windows: click on the download link above. This downloads an installer executable. Once downloaded, run the installer. You will get one or more warnings about running a potentially dodgy program from the internet. When you run the installer, you can just keep clicking the "Next" button on each page, going with the default install options.  
<br><br>
<b>How to play the game</b>
<br>
When you start the game, you should see this screen.

<br>If you don't, that's a serious problem! Please log a bug in the bug database! Click Start, then Multiplayer game. You then log in to the game using your email address, (but no-one else sees it - it's just a way of uniquely identifying you).
<br><br>
There is a small game world consisting of two connected locations. To move, click the ground where you want to go. You can chat to other players by clicking on them, if they are online.
