Broadcast console + Chat console
When KB hides or shows: if chat console is active, refresh size.
If chat console activated, hide broadcast console.
KB should have set bottom function. 
For emails, bottom is at bottom of screen.
Hopefully class Kb is reusable?


DONE
We give all our food to anyone we intersect -- just give one!
Causes lots of annoying msgs

Login bug
---------
If login times out, we kill off the http request, and create a new copy.
But this doesn't work - we end up getting a BAD_SESSION fault.
What's going on? Our session ID gets outdated when another login request hits.
What we could do: discard login reqs that were sent before the login req we
have granted? -- so add a timestamp to the req.

DONE
Lurk msg interferes with GUI keyboard.
Don't draw anything over the KB.


DONE: don't eat food, just pic up and give to other people.
 - reduce game design complexity

Show human-readable error msgs


Check cog tests ok, storing results etc. Check reporting works.



Level design
Have some variety in background. 
Ideally want buildings, trees etc to collide.
Buildings have AABBs, so should just work, but the 3D top-down view of buildings could be confusing?
Adding boxes to obj mesh could work?
